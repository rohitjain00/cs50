0.  world's largest word
1.  shows the resource usage of a process
2.  16 members
3.  to make program fast and cancel the time to call by value
4.  for loop runs till we hit the EOF character
    if the first character of file is character or apostrophes then the first if loop is executed
    now the character is appended in the words we created for every word in index position and the index is increased by one
    but if the index exceeds the LENGTH of word then ignore the whole word and set index to zero

    else if we found a word in which the char is number then also ignore the whole word as we would accept only alphabetical word and set index to zero


    else if we found the index to be greater then zero then we terminate the current word and add \0 i.e end of word and we add one in words
    now to check the time taken we used getrusage and to check misspelled we used the function misspelled that returns true if true and false if false
    and if the misspelled is true then it prints the word and increases the misspellings by one
    and after all this set the index to zero in order to get new word

5.  to make sure we get only the alphabets in word and not alphanumeric word or any special character
6.  to make sure the argument's values does not get changed anyway
